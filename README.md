# 📦 Where Things Live

**Code**

```
~/.local/share/cowcode
```

**Config, auth, reminders**

```
~/.cowcode
```

Everything stays on your computer.

**WhatsApp** session files live under `~/.cowcode/auth_info`. **Telegram** bot tokens and settings live in `~/.cowcode/config.json` (and `.env` there), not next to the program files.

**Git / clones:** If you develop from a `git clone` of this repo, runtime data still defaults to **`~/.cowcode`**—so a normal `git push` does **not** upload your chats, auth, or API keys. If you deliberately set **`COWCODE_STATE_DIR`** to a folder **inside** the clone, treat that folder like secrets; this repo’s `.gitignore` also ignores common state layout names at the **repository root** (`/agents/`, `/memory/`, etc.) so they are harder to commit by mistake.

# 🌊 Tide (follow-up after silence)

Tide sends **one** follow-up per conversation round when the user doesn't reply. Configure in `~/.cowcode/config.json`:

```json
"tide": {
  "enabled": true,
  "silenceCooldownMinutes": 60,
  "inactiveStart": "23:00",
  "inactiveEnd": "06:00"
}
```

* **enabled** — Off by default (`false`). Set to `true` to enable.
* **silenceCooldownMinutes** — Both how often we check and how long the chat must be silent before pinging (default 30). We only wake up every N minutes and only send if there’s been no message in or out for at least N minutes.
* **jid** — Where to send the agent’s reply (your WhatsApp JID or Telegram chat id). If omitted, Tide auto-detects: with Telegram it uses the bot owner's private chat (config.owner.telegramUserId), or the most recently active private chat. Set only to override (e.g. a specific WhatsApp JID).
* **inactiveStart** — 24h time (e.g. `"23:00"`). Tide will not run at or after this time (in your local timezone from `agents.defaults.userTimezone`).
* **inactiveEnd** — 24h time (e.g. `"06:00"`). Tide will not run before this time. With `inactiveStart` after `inactiveEnd`, this defines an overnight quiet window (e.g. 11 PM–6 AM).

Tide is designed to be quietly helpful: it only speaks after real silence, keeps messages short and tied to recent context (e.g. “Still no reply on that—should I follow up?” or “Tests passed. What’s next?”), and does not double-text if you don’t answer.
